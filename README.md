# ðŸ”— DevOps Project 03: Kubernetes Deployment with Helm Charts + Monitoring

This guide documents the steps followed to create a **DevOps project** focused on deploying a Flask or Nginx application into **Kubernetes** using **Minikube**, along with monitoring setup via **Prometheus + Grafana**. The application was also packaged using **Helm charts** to simplify deployment and configuration.

---

## ðŸ”— Objectives Completed

* Installed and used **Minikube** and optionally K3d
* Deployed a Flask or Nginx app using Kubernetes YAML and Helm
* Set up monitoring with **Prometheus + Grafana**
* Packaged the app into a reusable **Helm chart**

## ðŸ”— System Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 20.04 or later
* Docker, kubectl, and Helm installed

### ðŸ”— Commands to Verify Setup

Check if Minikube is installed:

```bash
which minikube
```

If not present, Minikube was installed using:

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
rm minikube-linux-amd64
```

Verify:

```bash
minikube version
```

Install kubectl (if not already available):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
curl -fsSL https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubectl
```

### ðŸ”— Check Cluster Status and Drivers

The following commands helped verify the current state and configuration of Minikube:

```bash
minikube status        # displays the status of the Minikube cluster (running, paused, stopped)
minikube profile list  # lists all Minikube profiles available on the machine
minikube drivers       # lists the container drivers (like docker, virtualbox) supported by Minikube
```

### ðŸ”— Confirm Tool Versions

These commands were used to verify that the installed versions of tools are available and functioning as expected:

```bash
minikube version          # shows the version of Minikube installed
helm version              # displays Helm version and client details
kubectl version --client  # outputs the client version of kubectl installed
```
---

## ðŸ”— Step 1: Start Minikube (Kubernetes Cluster Creation)

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

This command initializes the Kubernetes control plane and provisions a single-node cluster using Docker as the driver.

Optionally, ingress addon was enabled:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

---

## ðŸ”— Common kubectl Commands Used

* `kubectl get nodes` â€” Displays active nodes
* `kubectl get pods` â€” Lists all running pods
* `kubectl get services` â€” Displays service mappings
* `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` â€” Shows pod details
* `kubectl logs <pod-name>` â€” Retrieves container logs
* `kubectl apply -f file.yaml` â€” Applies Kubernetes configuration
* `kubectl delete -f file.yaml` â€” Removes resources defined in YAML

---

## ðŸ”— Step 2: Helm Chart Packaging for Flask App

A Helm chart was created for the app:

```bash
helm create charts/flask-app
```

The default templates (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`) were customized to suit the Flask application.

The `values.yaml` file was modified with actual Docker Hub repository info:

```yaml
image:
  repository: <dockerhub-username>/flask-app
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 5000
```

---

## ðŸ”— Step 3: Build & Deploy Flask App with Helm

Docker image was built and pushed:

```bash
cd flask-app
docker build -t <dockerhub-username>/flask-app .
docker push <dockerhub-username>/flask-app
```

Helm was used to deploy the application:

```bash
helm install flask charts/flask-app
```

To confirm deployment:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

To apply changes:

```bash
helm upgrade flask charts/flask-app
```

To remove the deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall flask
```

---

## ðŸ”— Step 4: Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

Helm repos were added:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Prometheus and Grafana were installed:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
helm install grafana grafana/grafana --set adminPassword='admin' --set service.type=NodePort
```

Credentials were retrieved:

```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
```

Grafana UI was accessed:

```bash
minikube service grafana
```

Prometheus was added as a data source in Grafana to enable dashboard creation.

---

## ðŸ”— Outcome

The following milestones were completed:

* A Kubernetes cluster was set up locally using Minikube
* A Flask app was containerized and packaged using Helm
* The app was deployed on Kubernetes via Helm
* Monitoring was added through Prometheus and Grafana
